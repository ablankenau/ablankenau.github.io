    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p id="about-me">
    I am a junior at <a href="http://www.oxy.edu/">Occidental College</a> pursuing a major in
    <a href="https://www.oxy.edu/academics/areas-study/psychology">Psychology</a> and a minor in <a href="
    https://www.oxy.edu/academics/areas-study/gender-women-sexuality-studies">Gender, Women, & Sexuality Studies.</a>
    In <a href="https://www.oxy.edu/academics/faculty/andrea-hopmeyer">Dr. Andrea Hopmeyer's</a> Social-Developmental Psychology lab, I am currently leading a research study
    examining reasons for loneliness among emerging adults in college with a focus on gender- and sexual- minority students.
    On campus, I work as a Writing Adviser in Occidental's <a href="https://www.oxy.edu/academics/academic-support/writing-center">
    Writing Center</a> where I help students improve their writing skills in collaborative 30 minute sessions at any stage
    in the writing process. After Occidental, I plan to attend graduate school to pursue a PhD in Counseling Psychology.
    My career goals are to become a licensed Psychologist, therapist, and researcher who is accessible to the
    LGBTQIA+ community, low-income and communities of color, and international adoptees.
